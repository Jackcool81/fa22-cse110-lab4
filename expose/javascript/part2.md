1. prints 3 since i is a var
2. prints 450 since discountedPrice is a var
3. prints 450 since finalPrice is a var
4. [-50, 100, 450] the values here are returned correctly since discounted is a var. -50 is put there from multiplying 100 by -0.5, 100 is there from multiplying 200 by 0.5, and 450 is there from multiplying 300 by 1.5
5. error since i is declared inside the for loop, and it is a let 
6. Error since discountedPrice is declared as a let inside the for loop
7. 450, finalPrice is declared in the same block as it is accessed
8. [ -50, 100, 450 ], since discounted is declared in the same block it was returned in
9. error, since i is declared in the for loop with let 
10. 3, prints the length of prices saved into the const length
11. [ -50, 100, 450 ]

17. [2, 4, 6], we start looping through input array then use the variable callback holding the function doSomething on each element. Effectively doubling our list at each index
